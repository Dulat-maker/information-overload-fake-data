# information-overload-fake-data
## Problem
People are exposed to massive amounts of information online, making it difficult
to distinguish reliable data from fake or misleading content.

## Solution
We propose an AI-based system that analyzes textual information and provides
an explainable credibility assessment instead of a simple true/false label.

## Technologies
- Python
- NLP
- Machine Learning
- scikit-learn / PyTorch (planned)

## Project Status
Current stage: Early prototype (MVP).
The repository will be updated during development.
